# RANGANNAGARI GURU MOHITH
### Software Engineer | Backend & Enterprise Systems

A disciplined, mission-driven Computer Science student at VIT Chennai, dedicated to mastering the art of building robust, scalable, and efficient software. My focus is on understanding systems from first principles, from the low-level logic of algorithms to the high-level architecture of enterprise applications. I am currently forging my skills through a structured regimen of daily problem-solving, backend project development, and a deep-dive into the Java ecosystem.

### My Doctrine
- **Master the Core:** A relentless focus on Data Structures and Algorithms is the foundation of my daily practice. True mastery comes from understanding the "why," not just the "how."
- **Build with Purpose:** I believe in building real-world projects that solve complex problems. My energy is directed towards creating functional, well-architected applications, not just academic exercises.
- **Discipline is the Weapon:** Consistency is my most valuable tool. The daily, deliberate practice of coding, learning, and building is the only path to excellence.
